ðŸ§  Project Title: Smart Industrial Process Management System
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project represents a modular, object-oriented system for managing and simulating industrial and management processes.
It models relationships between Processes, Resources, and Operations, providing a structured way to simulate how various resource types (human, hardware, software, and material) interact in both management and industrial contexts.

The architecture is based on abstract classes, inheritance, and composition to achieve extensibility and maintainability.
