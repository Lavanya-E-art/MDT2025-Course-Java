Problem Statement
Create a project that describes the functionality of an Industrial Process (IndustrialProcess) for a warehouse.
The process consists of N operations (IOperation), and each operation should involve a variety of Autonomous Driving Vehicles (AGV).

The general description of the process is provided in the UML Class Diagram.

Requirements
Implement the simulation of several industrial processes.
Print the following details for each process:
The time required to complete the process
The number of AGVs required
The energy consumption


Ouput:
Industrial Process ID: P1
Operation Details : ID = OP1, Desc = Load Materials, Time = 20 mins, AGVs = 1
Operation Details : ID = OP2, Desc = Transport Materials, Time = 40 mins, AGVs = 2
Operation Details : ID = OP3, Desc = Import Items, Time = 30 mins, AGVs = 3
Total Duration: 90 mins
Unique AGVs Required: 3
Estimated Energy Consumption: 555.0 units
